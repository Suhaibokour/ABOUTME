###### Pedagogy Vs Andragogy 
pedagogy is a child-focused teaching approach, whereas andragogy an adult-focused teaching approach or, pedagogy is the art and science of helping kids learn, whereas andragogy is the art and science of helping adults learn.


**Pedagogy Vs Andragogy: 5 Main Differences**
1. Learning behavior.  

 Adult learners are self directed; they have control over their learning experience and they are 100% responsible for their own learning. They are also deeply involved not only in planning, but also in evaluating their learning, as they know what knowledge they want to acquire. On the contrary, young learners are not self-directed; they still depend on their teachers throughout the learning process. Therefore, their teachers should be responsible not only of what will be taught, but also of how it will be taught and evaluated.  

2. The role of learners’ experience.  

Adult learners have clearly more experience than young learners. Their experience becomes the main resource of both their learning and the personal identity they have developed, as the richer and more diverse their experience, the more the diversity they can bring to their own learning. Young learners, on the other hand, present little personal experience by default, and so it is impossible for this experience to serve as a learning resource; it can be only used to build upon.

3. Orientation to learning.  
What kind of knowledge adult learners are most interested in? Naturally, adult learners seek information that is useful in their personal lives and work environment. This audience demands that their learning is relevant to their real life issues, problems, and tasks, and that their education will boost their performance levels and help them live their lives in a better, and more satisfying way. Young audience’s learning, on the contrary, is subject centered, mearning that the subject determines the sequence according to which the learning content units will be presented and taught.  
4. Readiness to learn.  
Adult learners’ readiness to learn can be triggered by literally anything; a sudden change in their lives, a need for dealing with life tasks and problems more successfully, the desire for self-improvement and self-development, and so on. Adults need to know why to learn something; as soon as they answer this question, they are ready to start. Children, on the other hand, are usually told what to learn; the reason behind their learning is developing their skills to achieve the next level of mastery.  

5. Motivation for learning.  
What motivates adults to find time for their learning in their busy schedule? Mostly intrinsic motivators; self-esteem, self-confidence, desire for better quality of life, curiosity, self-development, and recognition are only a few factors that motivate adult learners to learn. Needless to say, intrinsic incentives are much more powerful than extrinsic ones, and thus adult learners, more often than not, are more satisfied with the learning process, more focused, more persistent, and more eager to apply their knowledge more frequently and successfully than younger learners. On the other hand, children and teenagers are mostly motivated by extrinsic factors, such as getting good grades or other perks, or avoiding the consequences of failure.
